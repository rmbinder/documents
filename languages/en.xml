    <string name="PLG_DOCUMENTS_MAXPOSITIONS_DESC">The serial number is padded with zeros up to the maximum number of digits.\n\nAdmidio uses, for example, '1', '12' or '111' as the membership number (or serial number). However, for better sorting, the file names of the documents are used as '0001', '0012' or '0111'. The number set here specifies how many digits the serial number will be extended to by leading zeros.\n\nExample: The file name is '0015-Doe Jane-Membership Declaration.pdf' and the membership number in Admidio is 15. With a maximum number of digits of 4, the membership number becomes '0015' and a comparison is positive. If the serial number already contains more characters than defined, the serial number will not be changed (i.e., not truncated). If max. number of digits = 0, NO leading zeros are added, the serial number is used unchanged.</string>

    <string name="PLG_DOCUMENTS_SEPARATOR_DESC">If you are working with file names without leading zeros in the serial number, e.g. '12-Meier Albert-Membership Declaration.pdf' or '2-Meier Hilde-Membership Declaration.pdf', the separator can be used to split the file name into a serial number and the respective remainder. The first occurrence of the separator is searched for and the file name is split at this point. Example of a file name with the separator '-': '2-Meier Hilde-Mitgliedserklärung.pdf'. In this example, the file name is split into '2' and 'Meier Hilde-Mitgliedserklärung.pdf'. The number '2' is used for further comparison with the serial number (or user_id or user_uuid).</string>
